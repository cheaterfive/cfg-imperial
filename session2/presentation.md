# Recap

---

**Structure of an HTML document:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
    <head>
      <!-- nothing written in the head section will show up when you open your browser, also this is a comment -->
    </head>
    <body>
      <p> Everything that is written here will appear on your screen when you open the file in a browser. </p>
    </body>
  </html>
```

**Things to remember:**

- The last tag open is the first one you must close
- There are paired tags such as ```<p> hello </p>``` and unpaired tags such as ```<br> or <hr> ```
- Make sure to indent your code properly 
- Always name the main page of your website index.html 
- Keep your code as clean as possible as in real life other people will read it and they need to understand what you did
- Sometimes that person could be you! 
- Just ignore the notification to buy Sublime
